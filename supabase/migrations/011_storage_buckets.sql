-- Create avatars storage bucket
-- Note: This needs to be run in Supabase Dashboard under Storage > Create Bucket
-- Or run via Supabase CLI

-- The bucket 'avatars' should be configured with:
-- - Public access: Yes (so avatar URLs can be displayed without auth)
-- - File size limit: 2MB
-- - Allowed MIME types: image/*

-- Create storage bucket (if using SQL)
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('avatars', 'avatars', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Allow public read access to avatars
CREATE POLICY "Avatar images are publicly accessible"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'avatars'
);

-- Allow users to update their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
)
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow users to delete their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
